#+DESCRIPTION: Using git-branch to create a detached branch of yuor repo that is then linked into master

Like so many other projects, this one lives on Github. Github pages is a great way to have a website for your project, but the way it is implemented might be tricky, if you decide not to use [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]].

Github projects are located in a child-folder of your Github accound, in perry.el's case =XXX=. The projects website is located in the gh-pages branch of the project.

The easiest way to setup your project to have you project in =master=, your branches in =whatever= and your blog/documentation in =gh-pages= is:

(This script needs to be ran from a repo checked out from GitHub)

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<script src="https://gist.github.com/QWxleA/412d0b7fb737afcf61cc8c8d42545942.js"></script>
#+END_EXPORT

When the script is done, you end up with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/repository
/repository/.nojekyll          -> keeps GitHub from trying to run jekyll on your project
/repository/.gitignore         -> keeps _export from being checked into the master branch
/repository/_export            -> linked to the gh-pages branch
/repository/_export/index.html -> your projects documentation
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Alternative

As an alternative you can use [[https://github.com/blog/2228-simpler-github-pages-publishing][Simpler GitHub Pages publishing]], but this has the downside that it has your generated content in your master branch.
